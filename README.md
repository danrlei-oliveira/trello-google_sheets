<h1>Integrating Trello with Google Sheets.</h1>
<p>This code performs an integration between Trello and Google Sheets using APIs to periodically check if tasks in a checklist have been completed.</p>
<p>We created the keys on Trello and the credentials in the Gogle Console for authentication. We identified the card IDs on Trello containing the checklist and the Google Spreadsheet.</p>
